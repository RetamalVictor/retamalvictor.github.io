bio:
  short: "ML Engineer specializing in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems applied to autonomous robotics."
  long: |
    I'm a Machine Learning Engineer advancing the state of autonomous systems through cutting-edge ML algorithms
    applied to robotics challenges. I develop novel deep learning architectures, computer vision models,
    and reinforcement learning algorithms that enable intelligent behavior in UAVs, ground robots, and multi-agent systems.

    My expertise spans computer vision for robotic perception (visual SLAM, object detection, visual servoing), deep reinforcement
    learning for control and decision-making, and multi-agent learning for distributed coordination. I leverage advanced ML techniques
    including transformer architectures, graph neural networks, and attention mechanisms to solve complex problems in navigation,
    manipulation, and swarm intelligence. I bridge the gap between cutting-edge algorithms and production-ready robotic systems.

    I develop and deploy learning-based solutions for autonomous systems, with particular focus on vision-based control (IBVS/PBVS),
    learned navigation policies using model-free and model-based RL, and scalable multi-agent algorithms for heterogeneous robot teams.
    My work has been validated across simulation platforms (Gazebo, Isaac Lab, MuJoCo) and physical systems including PX4-based
    UAVs and various ground robot platforms.
