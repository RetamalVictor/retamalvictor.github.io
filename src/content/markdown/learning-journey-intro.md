# Intro: Diving Into Open-Source Courses

Hey everyone! I'm starting a new series here on the blog called **My Learning Journey**. It's my way of sharing some cool stuff I'm learning, working on, and exploring through open-source courses available online.

I'm not officially enrolled in any university program at the moment, but I truly believe learning never stops. Recently, I've been diving into these fascinating courses designed by top instructors:

- **[Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/lectures/)** (completed last fall): This was an awesome exploration of how geometry and symmetry play into advanced machine learning models.

- **[Stanford CS149: Parallel Computing](https://cs149.stanford.edu/)**: Currently exploring how to harness multiple CPU cores to optimize performance and make computations lightning-fast.

- **[CMU 16-745: Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning](https://optimalcontrol.ri.cmu.edu/)**: Digging into the latest in reinforcement learning, figuring out how intelligent systems make smart decisions in complex situations.

- **[Applied Space System Engineering](https://aiaa.mycrowdwisdom.com/diweb/catalog/item?id=17366964)**: I'll soon start this course as part of my work-related learning journey. Hopefully, I will discover how system engineering is done in such a demanding industry as the space industry. Disclaimer: This is not open source, but it is still a cool/practical course to take.


I'll be sharing interesting projects, insights, and even challenges I run into. No strict posting schedule here—just whenever I stumble upon something interesting worth sharing!
As an example,  Here's a quick snapshot from one assignment where I solved an optimization problem to find a stable point for balancing a quadruped robot on one leg:

  <figcaption style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
    Balancing a quadruped robot using optimization techniques learned in CMU's Optimal Control course.

</figure>

With time, I'll probably add other courses and resources here, but for now, this will take a big chunk of my year to complete.

Oh, and another fun thing: I'm also experimenting with using AI tools like large language models (LLMs) to help with writing and organizing my thoughts. It's pretty cool seeing how these tools can enhance creativity and productivity.

Thanks for joining me on this journey—looking forward to sharing more soon!

Cheers
